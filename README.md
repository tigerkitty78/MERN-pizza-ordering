Okrrr this ones a little generic but it is good! My project is a pizza ordering app built using the MERN stack. It’s designed to give users a seamless experience while browsing and ordering pizzas. When users land on the home page, they’re greeted with a mouth-watering selection of pizzas, all fetched from the MongoDB database. 

On the front end,I used React.js to make everything interactive and snappy. Users can add pizzas to their cart, and as they do, the app automatically updates the total price, making it super easy to keep track of how much they're spending. Redux is the real chad here, managing all the behind-the-scenes state changes—like what’s in the cart, how many pizzas have been added, and what the total cost is—so the app feels smooth and responsive.

I’ve also got a search feature that lets users quickly find the exact pizza they’re craving. Whether they’re looking for a mushroomy pizza or a pineapple pizza, they can start typing, and the app will instantly filter the results.

On the back end, you’ve got Node.js running the show, with Express.js handling all the routing and API requests. When users interact with the app, like adding a pizza to their cart or searching for something specific, Axios jumps in to make the necessary requests to the server. The server then talks to MongoDB to get or update the data, and Redux ensures everything on the front end stays in sync.

And DUH postman was used!
